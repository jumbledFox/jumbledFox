Hello! I'm a 17 year old programmer from the UK.

RUST RUST RUST I LOVE RUST IT'S SO EPIC 

Most of my old code is.. well.. I'm still learning Rust and I'm a lot better at it than I was a few months ago, to say the least.

Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1972 album, Foxtrot.

Haven't used GitHub too much recently but I plan to make more stuff.!!

<!--- i regret ever thinking about cryptocurrency let alone tainting the commits of this repository with my *shudders* awful cringy 14 year old ramblings... don't worry now im cool :3 --->
