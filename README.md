Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1972 album, Foxtrot.

Haven't used GitHub too much recently but I plan to make more stuff.!!

<!--- i regret ever thinking about cryptocurrency let alone tainting the commits of this repository with my *shudders* awful cringy 14 year old ramblings... don't worry now im cool :3 --->
